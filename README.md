## üöÄ Objective

Build an end-to-end time series forecasting system that:
- Ingests and preprocesses historical supply chain data
- Experiments with ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM models
- Captures seasonality, trend, holidays, and volatility
- Provides forecasts via an interactive Streamlit frontend
- Tracks experiments using MLflow via DAGsHub
- Versions data, models, and pipelines using DVC

## üìä Dataset

The dataset includes features such as:

- Product type, SKU, Price, Availability  
- Number of products sold, Revenue generated  
- Customer demographics, Stock levels, Lead times  
- Order quantities, Shipping info (times, carriers, costs)  
- Supplier info (name, location, lead time)  
- Production volumes, costs, inspection results  
- Transportation modes, routes, and costs

üìÅ Example file path: `Notebooks/supply_chain_dataset.csv`
